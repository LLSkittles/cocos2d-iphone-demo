/**
 *  This method is called from the `applicaton:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` UIApplicationDelegate method. 
 *  It will configure Cocos2D with the options that you provide. You can leave out any of the options to have Cocos2D use default values.
 *  Some of the settings can be changed at runtime, for instance the debug stats.
 *
 *  Currently supported keys for the configuration dictionary are:
 *
 *  - `CCSetupPixelFormat`: NSString with the pixel format, normally `kEAGLColorFormatRGBA8` or `kEAGLColorFormatRGB565`. The RGB565 option is faster and recommended, unless color vibrancy is noticably impaired or you need the alpha channel.
 *  - `CCSetupScreenMode`: NSString value that accepts either `CCScreenModeFlexible` or `CCScreenModeFixed`.
 *  - `CCSetupScreenOrientation`: NSString value that accepts `CCScreenOrientationLandscape`, `CCScreenOrientationPortrait`, or `CCScreenOrientationAll`.
 *  - `CCSetupAnimationInterval`: NSNumber with double. Specifies the desired interval between animation frames. Supported values are `1.0/60.0` (default, 60 fps) and `1.0/30.0` (30 fps).
 *  - `CCSetupFixedUpdateInterval`: NSNumber with double. Specifies the desired interval between fixed updates. Should be smaller than `CCSetupAnimationInterval`. Defaults to `1.0/60.0` (60 Hz).
 *  - `CCSetupShowDebugStats`: NSNumber with bool. Specifies if the stats (FPS, frame time and draw call count) should be rendered. Defaults to NO.
 *  - `CCSetupTabletScale2X`: NSNumber with bool. If true, the iPad will be setup to act like it has a 512x384 points "logical" screen size with a "Retina" pixel resolution of 1024x768. 
 *      This makes it much easier to make universal iOS games. This is the default mode for SpriteBuilder projects. This value is ignored when using the fixed screen mode.
 *
 *  - `CCSetupDepthFormat`: NSNumber with integer. Specifies the desired depth buffer format. Values are 0 (no depth buffering), `GL_DEPTH24_STENCIL8_OES` (8-Bit depth buffer) and `GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24_OES` (24-bit depth buffer).
 *      Depth buffering is only needed in rare cases and comes at the expense of performance and additional memory usage.
 *  - `CCSetupPreserveBackbuffer`: NSNumber with bool. Specifies whether backbuffer will be preserved. Defaults to NO.
 *  - `CCSetupMultiSampling`: NSNumber with bool. Specifies whether multisampling (fullscreen anti-aliasing) is enabled. Defaults to NO.
 *  - `CCSetupNumberOfSamples`: NSNumber with integer. Specifies number of samples when multisampling is enabled. Ignored if multisampling is not enabled.
 *
 *  @param config Dictionary with setup options for Cocos2D.
