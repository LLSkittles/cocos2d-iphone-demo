/**
 Delegate type called when two physics bodies collide.
 
 
 ### Callback Method Signature
 
 The final two parameter names (typeA/typeB) should be replaced with names used with [CCPhysicsBody collisionType] or [CCPhysicsShape collisionType].
 So if collisionType of one body is `player` and other bodies use `ground` and the player collides with the ground, the collision method being called
 for that particular collision would have to be named `ccPhysicsCollisionBegin:player:ground:` with the player node passed in for the player parameter,
 and the ground node passed in for the ground parameter. You can also switch parameters as well and write `ground:player:` instead
 
If both final parameter names are "default" then the default collision method is called (ie ccPhysicsCollisionBegin:typeA:typeB:).
 
 
 ### "X collided with any" Callbacks
 
 "wildcard" can be used as the final parameter name to mean "collides with anything". For instance `ccPhysicsCollisionBegin:player:wildcard`.
 
When using wildcard methods, it's possible for up to three methods to be called (ex: bullet/monster, bullet/wildcard, monster/wildcard).
The most specific method (bullet/monster) will be called first, and then the wildcard handlers will be called in a somewhat random order.
Begin and PreSolve methods return a boolean. If multiple methods are called, their return values are combined with a logical AND.
 
 
 ### Collision Sequence
 
 On the first fixed time step (not necessarily frame) that two physics shapes collide for the first time, a `ccPhysicsCollisionBegin` method will be called.
 
As long as those objects stay in contact, a `ccPhysicsCollisionPreSolve` and `ccPhysicsCollisionPostSolve` method will be called before and after the physics solver runs.
The pre-solve method gives you a chance to modify the outcome of the collision, and the post-solve method lets you find out what the outcome was.
This means you cannot use the outcome of the collision to modify itself. For example, you can't discard or undo a collision when it did not cause enough damage.
 
Finally, when two physics objects stop touching for the very first fixed time step, the `ccPhysicsCollisionSeparate` method is called.
 
 
 ### CCPhysicsShape vs. CCPhysicsBody:
 
 Though Cocos2D physics concentrates mostly on physics bodies, the underlying physics engine (Chipmunk2D) operates collision callbacks on the level of individual shapes.
 
CCPhysicsBody objects can have multiple shapes such as polyline bodies or those created with [CCPhysicsBody bodyWithShapes:].
In those cases, its possible to have have multiple active collisions between two CCPhysicsBody objects. This is something to keep in mind.
 
 @note When using the default callbacks (ie `ccPhysicsCollisionBegin:typeA:typeB`) it is undefined which of two colliding nodes is passed in as typeA and which is passed
 in as typeB parameter. This can randomly change at any time even when the two colliding bodies are always the same.
 Therefore it's best to use collisionTypes and named callback methods respectively wildcard callback methods.

/**
A CCNode that enables physics simulation in it's children. Sometimes referred to as the "physics world" node.
 
 ### Creating a Physics Node
 
 The physics node has no designated initializer. You can create it with the standard `node` class method:
 
    CCPhysicsNode* physicsNode = [CCPhysicsNode node];

 ### Using Physics
 
To use physics in Cocos2D, you have to create a CCPhysicsNode instance and add it to the node hierarchy.
 Then add more nodes as children of the CCPhysicsNode instance. If those nodes have a CCPhysicsBody object assigned to their
 [CCNode physicsBody] property they will take part in the physics simulation (ie affected by forces, colliding, etc.).
 
 ### Collision Callbacks
 
The CCPhysicsNode instance is also where you assign the collision delegate object that receives collision event callbacks,
 as defined by the CCPhysicsCollisionDelegate protocol.
 
You can also use the physics node to query for physics objects near a point, along a ray, or within a certain bounding box.

 ### About Units
 
For simplicity, CCPhysicsNode does not use [SI units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units), 
 and the performance is not adversely affected by not adhering to a particular scale, as in other 2D physics engines.
 
- **Positions and distances** are expressed in regular Cocos2D points relative to whatever node is most relevant. For example,
 positions are in the same coordinate system as the CCPhysicsNode instance.
- **Shapes and joint anchors** use the local coordinate system of the body's CCNode instance, so that they properly respect its transform.
- **Mass** has no particular units. It's most intuitive to use 1.0 as the main player's or most common object's mass and scale everything relative to this "reference mass".
- **Time** is expressed in seconds.
